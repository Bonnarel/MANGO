\begin{abstract}
The Mango model proposes a flexible way to make source data interoperable. It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in term of both format and usage. 
Each Mango source is defined by an identifier on which  one can attach a set of parameters and a set of associated data. Parameters are modeled by  MCT both native and extended classes. Their roles are given by UCDs and semantic tags.
Associated data can be simple URLs, VO service endpoints or VO data model instances. Their roles are given by semantic tags.

\section{Introduction}

The source DM is a long term concern for the DM working group and more generally for the IVOA.
In the past years, there were some proposals to design a global model for sources \citep{wd:jesusdm} of for catalogs \citep{wd:catalog}.
Other proposals, more model-agnostic, were focused on the data annotation in VOTables \citep{note:stcvot} \citep{note:seb}. In this case the goal was no longer to design a source model but to provide a complete description of  individual quantities (positions, velocity…).
None of these proposals have come to completion

The source DM issue resurfaced at the spring 2018 Interop in Victoria during an hands-on session focused on the tools available to work with VO data models and especially with VO-DML. The goal of this session was to annotate data from different origins in order to make them interoperable with each other. The main concern expressed during this session was not related to the tools themselves but to the lack of models for sources. 
This is a big paradox in the VO world ; source data which represent the basic bricks of the astronomer work, have no model. This paradox can be explained by the fact that sources data are multifaceted. The way of which source data are organized depends on the survey they come from, one the way they have been generated  and on the expected use. In a more general way, it depends on the science we want to do with them. This diversity cannot be endorsed by a single model. Having a global source model would lead to a very complex solution not usable in practice.

This standard proposes to overcome this paradox presenting model based on independent components and associated data that can be embedded on demand in a container.

\section{Model Overview}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../model/overview_diagram.png}
\caption{Mango overview}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The root class of the model is the \texttt{Source} class that has only one attribute, the identifier. The identifier is the only quantity common to  all  Mango instances.

Each quantity or associated data attached to the source is represented by a connector describing the nature of the quantity or of the associated data.

There is no restriction on the set of connectors attached to one source.
There are 2 classes of connectors

\subsection{The parameters} 
Parameter connectors are used to bind measures with the source. One connector can only reference one measure. The measure itself is modeled by a class of the Measure model or by an extension of this model. Measure extensions are part of Mango. 
In addition to its class, the nature of a measure is given by a UCD and a semantic tag. The UCD gives the physical meaning of the measure whereas the semantic tag says more about the usage context of the measure. This can be for instance the reduction status (raw, corrected). The vocabulary allowed for the semantic is managed as a VO vocabulary. 

\subsubsection{Parameter UCD}

\begin{table}[ht!]
     \begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{3cm}|p{3.5cm}|}
       \hline Parameter &  Original model & UCDs 1+ first word  \\
       \hline  \texttt{Position}             &  Measure  &  pos \\       
       \hline  \texttt{Velocity  }            &  Measure & phys.veloc      \\              
       \hline  \texttt{Proper motion}    & Measure & pos.pm    \\       
       \hline  \texttt{Time}                   & Measure &  time.epoch   \\       
       \hline  \texttt{Polarization}         & Measure & phys.polarization \\      
       \hline  \texttt{SphericalSkyPosition}    &  Mango  &  pos \\       
       \hline  \texttt{ObjectType}                   &  Mango  & src.class \\       
       \hline  \texttt{Redshift}                        &  Mango  & src.redshift \\       
       \hline  \texttt{Luminosity}                    &  Mango  & phys.luminosity \\
       \hline  \texttt{HardnessRatio}             &  Mango  & phot.flux;arith.ratio \\
       \hline  \texttt{Shape}                    &  Mango  & src.morph \\
       \hline  \texttt{Flag}                    &  Mango  & meta.code  \\
       \hline  \texttt{Orbit}                    &  Mango  & src.orbital\\    
       \hline  \texttt{GenericMeasure}                    &  Measure  &  free \\    
       \hline 
     \end{tabular}
     \caption{ UCDs to be set for the supported parameters} 
     \label{tab:ucds}
 \end{table}

TBC phys.luminosity  vs phot.flux

\subsection{Associated Data} 
Associated data connectors are used to bind any sort of complex data with the source. One connector can only refer to one dataset. Associated data can be either URIs (VO services or not) or reference to instances of other VO models (Obscore, Provenance…).

Attaching VO model instances to sources does not mean that these  models must be imported. The merge between a Mango instance and one associated instance is operated by the data annotation process. The indication given by Mango tell the client how to interpret the embedded instance

\subsection{STC Extension} 

All STC measures are built upon the same pattern (see fig \ref{fig:stcpattern}). The value(s) \texttt{Measure} object is carried by a \texttt{Coordinate} object. The coordinate is attached to a system (class \texttt{CoordSys}). The system has 2 components 1) the space  (class \texttt{CoordSpace}) that describes the axis and 2) the frame    \texttt{CoordFrame}).  All Mango parameters are based on this pattern. Native STC classes are used when possible. Others parameters are built by extending STC classes . Figure \ref{fig:stcpattern}) shows the extended STC classes being part of Mango

\section{TAP and Mango}
This not normative section gives possible tips to save and discover Mango instances in TAP services.
We suppose that the TAP service hosts catalogs which sources are Mango instances. These catalogs are named \emph{Mango Catalogs}.

\subsection{Storing Mango Catalogs in TAP}
For now this section only concerns the parameter. The associated data will be taken into account later.

\begin{itemize}
  \item One master table for the catalogs with various meta-data out of the Mango scope plus a unique identifier (primary key)
  \item One master sources table for the source instances with the catalog identifier and a primary key safer than the Mango identifier.
  \item One table for each supported parameter with a foreign key for the join with the master source table
\end{itemize}

Although the model of the measures is hierarchical, it should be possible to flatten them in one single table considering that the model structure can be retrieved with the TAP\_SCHEMA annotations (TBC) 

This schema requires the server to explore all the parameter tables to retrieve  whole Mango instances. This process can be speed up by using the \emph{MangoCore} table.

\subsection{ \emph{MangoCore} Table}

The discovery of \emph{Mango Catalogs} can be helped by a  \emph{MangoCore} table located in the  \emph{schema} schema. As Mango is not dedicated to any specific domain, we cannot define a set of core parameters, but parameters can be flagged as \emph{Core Parameter}. This selection is left at the discretion of the curator.
The \emph{MangoCore} table has set of columns per parameter class plus one for the catalog ID. It has one row per stored catalog. Each parameter has at least 2 columns: one with the UCD an one with the \emph{Core} flag. TBC
